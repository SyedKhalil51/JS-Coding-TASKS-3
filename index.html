    <h3> 1. Problem Name: ComparisonOperators: </h3>
    <h6>List down the comparison operators. What happens if you write 4<=5?</h6>
    <ul>
        <li> == </li>
        <li> === </li>
        <li> != </li>
        <li> !== </li>
        <li> > </li>
        <li> < </li>
        <li> >= </li>
        <li> <= </li>
        <li> ? </li>
    </ul>

    <p> The Answer Will be True as 4 is less than 5. As per condition 4 should be less than or equals to 5 so 4 is less than 5 so condition is true.</p>

    <h3> 2. Problem Name: AssignmentOperators:  </h3>
    <p>
        What will happen if:
        x=3; x+1; x+=3;
    </p>
    <h3> 3. Problem Name: LogicalOperators: </h3>
    <p>In AND Operator, If Both The conditions are true, the condition will be true, if both the condition are true , if one of the given condition will be false the result be will false. in the given set True & True , the both conditions are true so the ans is true. In False && True, The answer will be false because one condition is false so ans will be false. 
        In False && False, The both conditions are false so the ans is false.  In False || True condition, as this is OR operator in OR operator if one of the condition is true the ans is true.
